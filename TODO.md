- get a p5js Typescript template working (want that editor goodness)
- use templating to generate a links to the full tree of sketches
  - i.e. the base index.html should have a templated version that I can run some generation script on locally
- how to handle references to data? for my local live server (that hot reloads) vs when it's hosted on GH
